## Theory

### CT scans 

- brief overview of ct scans
- sinograms

*left:* a 2D slice of the phantom the colour gradient representing bone density. *right* corresponding sinogram with 64 projection angles and a detector size in the y-direction of 64 pixels

### Filtered back projection

- brief overview backprojection 
- list issues 

### iterative reconstruction 

- brief overview itterative approach (with references to Mechlem)
- positives
- negatives

### machine learning - CNN

- How in image processing CNN have been used before


### Machine learning - Attention

- How we want to map the sinogram to the image, which is non-local (link attention is all you need)
